## Current interests

I am currently immersed in experimenting with the possibilities of new artificial intelligence models. Here's my [Midjourney profile](https://www.midjourney.com/app/users/a84478b1-c8e7-439f-ad27-6d3e1a2906e8/) and here's the [Pokemon guessing game](https://varisparvi.net/poke.html) completely generated by ChatGPT for my daughters from the description (javascript in the html page, I haven't touched the code in any way other than copy-paste).

I think the development of AI over the last year is both amazing and somewhat worrying at the same time. I believe that there is an avalanche of changes going on comparable to the spread of the internet, which will however happen much faster and more uncontrollably. I'm not saying we necessarily need restrictions, but we definitely need openness and research.
