## Current interests

I am currently immersed in experimenting with the possibilities of new artificial intelligence models.

I think the development of AI over the last year is both amazing and somewhat worrying at the same time. I believe that there is an avalanche of changes going on comparable to the spread of the internet, which will however happen much faster and more uncontrollably. 

I'm not at all worried about the tech jobs, and I'm not saying we necessarily need more restrictions, but we definitely need transparency and open research.
